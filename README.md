# Elevate

Allows you to trade stocks and bitcoin through a simple, easy-to-use Facebook Messenger Chatbot.

# Elevate

Stocks/investments can be intimidating. This is a HackMIT project to get college students started with stocks! 

## Setup

Set the values in `config/default.json` before running the sample. Descriptions of each parameter can be found in `app.js`. Alternatively, you can set the corresponding environment variables as defined in `app.js`.

Replace values for `APP_ID` and `PAGE_ID` in `public/index.html`.

## Run

You can start the server by running `npm start`. However, the webhook must be at a public URL that the Facebook servers can reach. Therefore, running the server locally on your machine will not work.

You can run this example on a cloud service provider like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform or AWS. Note that webhooks must have a valid SSL certificate, signed by a certificate authority. Read more about setting up SSL for a [Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks#setup).

## Webhook

All webhook code is in `app.js`. It is routed to `/webhook`. This project handles callbacks for authentication, messages, delivery confirmation and postbacks. More details are available at the [reference docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference).

## "Send to Messenger" and "Message Us" Plugin

An example of the "Send to Messenger" plugin and "Message Us" plugin are located at `index.html`. The "Send to Messenger" plugin can be used to trigger an authentication event. More details are available at the [reference docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/plugin-reference).
